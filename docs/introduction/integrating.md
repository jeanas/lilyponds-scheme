# Integrating Scheme in LilyPond

The second challenge is the integration of Scheme as an extension language in
LilyPond input files. Actually this works quite smoothly because LilyPond's
language itself is parsed in a way that is very close to Scheme.  But on the
other hand this affinity can be confusing to the user.  I will give particular
emphasis on disentangling these things by discussing Scheme always from the
perspective of a LilyPond user.  After the general
[Scheme](../scheme.index.html) bookpart I will cover the integration of Scheme
*in LilyPond* in more depth, in a bookpart dedicated to the integration of
[Scheme in LilyPond](../lilypond/index.html).
