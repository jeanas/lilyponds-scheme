# Interacting With LilyPond Internals

The third challenge is the more advanced interaction with LilyPond's internals
that is possible through Scheme.  LilyPond can reveal information about every
object's most secret properties, and the user can interact very closely with
these internals.  This is the part where the average LilyPond user tends to give
up and will even be more confused than informed by the helping hands given by
more knowledgeable people on the mailing lists.  But on the other hand this is
where the true power of extending LilyPond can finally be unleashed. And: this
becomes much more accessible once the user has a firm understanding of the
fundamentals of Scheme and its integration in LilyPond documents.

The [third part](../advanced/index.html) of this book will introduce selected
topics from this field, but is less targeted at being a comprehensive guide.
