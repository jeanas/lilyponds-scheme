# Scheme Concepts

The following chapters introduce fundamental concepts of Scheme.  To some extent
this introduction is independent from LilyPond, as most of the concepts are
general Scheme techniques.  However, they are all taken from the LilyPond
perspective.

We start with discussing *data types*, followed by a sequence of discussions of
more complex concepts and techniques.
