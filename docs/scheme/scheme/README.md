# Scheme Fundamentals

This main part of the book  covers the fundamentals of Scheme as used in
LilyPond documents.  However, while it *does* give a basic explanation how
Scheme code is integrated in LilyPond documents its focus is the language
itself.  In particular it doesn't give many examples that would make much sense
in real-world documents, so if you work through the book in order you may find
that part not to be real fun.  However, I think that it is crucial to have a
firm understanding of these fundamentals because it's exactly these that make
using Scheme in LilyPond so (unnecessarily) confusing if not learned properly.

If it is an issue for you having to learn the concepts without the opportunity
to try them out right away I have two alternative suggestions for you.  You may
jump directly to the [Scheme in LilyPond](../lilypond/index.html) part.  But as
I won't explain the fundamental concepts there again you will need to jump back
and forth to look up anything you have difficulties with.  This way you will
only need to read through the explanations of what you really need, but on the
other hand you run the risk of neglecting some fundamental understanding.

As another “offer” this part of the book provides a [Music Function
Primer](music-function-primer.html), which gives you a few tools to use as
building blocks in LilyPond documents.  With these you can try out the Scheme
concepts in actual score contexts.  However, even if you intend to go that way I
strongly recommend reading the next two chapters before.
