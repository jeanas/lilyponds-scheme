# Lists and Pairs

*Lists* and *pairs* are the fundamental entities in Scheme programming, which is
pretty natural as Scheme is a member of the
[LISP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_%28programming_language%29) family of
languages whose name is derived from *LIS*t *P*rocessing.  We have already
touched lists in the course of discussing [expressions](../expressions.html),
but now we are going to have a much closer look at them.  Lists are constructed
from pairs, so it's actually the pair that makes the foundation of Scheme's
data structures.

There are so many walls one can run into with lists and pairs when one isn't
perfectly clear about all the different quotes and backticks, dots and parens
and how to apply all those.  Therefore it is really well-spent time and energy
to get one's head properly around them.
